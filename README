FavCas : The Twitter Client for Fav
1.0 beta
May Akizuru - @maytheplic

FavCas is a client specializing in fav.

Requirements:
 * Windows Vista or later
 * .NET Framework 4 or later

Features:
 * FavCas has ability to fav and retweet ONLY
 * Keyboard binding is fully customizable
 * Mouse-over Fav

Notices to build:
 * There are no "Properties/Resources.resx" and "Properties/Resources.Designer.cs".
   So please create a resource file from project's property.
   The resource must include 2 items: "ConsumerKey" and "ConsumerSecret".
 * If "Enable Just My Code (managed only)" is enabled,
   Visual Studio will show exception helper window for AuthenticationFailureException in authTask (MainWindow.xaml.cs).
   This exception will be catched in following code (try-catch block that includes authTask.Wait()).
   When VS shows the helper window, just ignore the exception and continue.
   (This application will be shutdown when AuthenticationFailureException is thrown.)
